ServerPush for Vaadin uses the Atmosphere Framework by Jeanfrancois Arcand
https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere

The example in the web/ directory shows how to configure Atmosphere for your web application.

Note that the <url-pattern/> for the Atmosphere servlet must be the same as the context-root attribute in META-INF/atmosphere.xml.
This value will always be "/server-push"; therefore, in Vaadin, if your custom widgetset is named "mywidgetset"
then the URL will be <servlet context path>/server-push.
